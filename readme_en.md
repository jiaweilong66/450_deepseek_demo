## API_Key fill in
In the API_Key.py script file, fill in your Baidu APP_ID, API Key, Secret Key

# 7 Case reproduction

Run deepseek_demo.py, press the Enter key, and the recording will start

**Notes**
When recording, it is necessary to do it in a quiet environment. When converting voice to text, the conversion may be incorrect. You can wait until the robot arm completes the action, and then press the Enter key again to speak the command

## Mobile display

**Voice command words**:
```bash
向前移动50毫米，向后移动40毫米，向左移动30毫米，向右移动60毫米。
```

## Color recognition
The colored wooden blocks should be placed neatly, and a certain distance should be kept between the wooden blocks, otherwise the robot arm cannot complete the grasping normally
, please refer to the following figure for placement

![Picture](./img/color.png)

**Voice command words**:
```bash
先把番茄一样颜色的木块拿走,再把和香蕉一样颜色的木块拿走。
```
## Fruit recognition
The fruit models should be placed neatly and a certain distance should be kept between them, otherwise the robot arm cannot grasp them normally. Please refer to the following figure for placement. If you want to grasp a banana, place it vertically

![Image](./img/fruit.png)

**Voice command**:
```bash
我现在有点口渴，帮我拿个橙子。
```

```bash
我现在有点饿，帮我拿个苹果。
```
**Note**: Currently, fruit recognition only supports the recognition of apples, oranges, and bananas

## Drug recognition
The medicine boxes to be grasped must be placed neatly and vertically, without too much angle deviation, and a certain distance should be kept between the medicine boxes, otherwise the robot arm cannot grasp them normally. Please refer to the following figure for placement.

![图片](./img/yao.png)

**Notes**: Currently, the medicine box recognition only supports the recognition of 999 Ganmao Ling Granules and Yunnan Baiyao Band-Aids. If you want to reproduce, please prepare this medicine box in advance

**Voice command words**:
```bash
我有点流鼻涕和鼻塞，帮我取个治疗这个症状的药。
```
